## Why RevAIse?

The integration of AI into systematic literature reviews promises to accelerate research synthesis, but it also introduces critical challenges:

- **Reproducibility Crisis**: How can we ensure AI-assisted reviews can be independently verified and replicated?
- **Transparency Gap**: What prompts, models, and decision criteria were actually used?
- **Method Fragmentation**: Every team uses different tools, formats, and workflows, making collaboration difficult
- **Trust Deficit**: Without standardized documentation, how can readers assess the quality and reliability of AI-assisted reviews?

**RevAIse addresses these challenges by providing a comprehensive, open standard for documenting every aspect of AI-assisted systematic reviews.**

## What is RevAIse?

RevAIse is a structured data model that captures:

- **Complete Review Metadata** - From protocol registration to final synthesis
- **AI Usage Documentation** - Models, prompts, parameters, and decisions
- **Search Strategies** - Queries, databases, and result collections
- **Screening & Extraction** - Criteria, decisions, and human-in-the-loop processes
- **Full Reproducibility** - Software environments, data versions, and computational steps

## Who Benefits?

### Researchers
- Document your AI-assisted review process comprehensively
- Share reproducible research artifacts with the community
- Build on existing reviews with full transparency

### Journal Editors & Peer Reviewers
- Assess the methodological rigor of AI-assisted reviews
- Verify compliance with reporting standards (PRISMA, etc.)
- Ensure reproducibility requirements are met

### Tool Developers
- Build interoperable tools that speak a common language
- Import/export review data across platforms
- Contribute to an open ecosystem

### Research Institutions
- Establish best practices for AI-assisted evidence synthesis
- Ensure research outputs meet transparency standards
- Build institutional knowledge bases

## Key Features

- **Open Standard** - Community-governed, CC0 licensed (public domain), and freely available
- **Technology Agnostic** - Works with any AI model or review tool
- **FAIR Principles** - Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable data
- **Multiple Formats** - JSON, YAML, RDF, and more
- **Extensible** - Adapt to your specific domain needs
- **Version Controlled** - Track changes in your review methodology

## Quick Start

### For Researchers
Start documenting your AI-assisted review using the RevAIse schema:

1. **Browse the Schema**: [Documentation](https://open-and-sustainable.github.io/revaise-model/)
2. **Download Templates**: [JSON Schema](https://open-and-sustainable.github.io/revaise-model/schema/latest/revaise.schema.json)
3. **Validate Your Data**: Use standard JSON Schema validators

### For Developers
Integrate RevAIse into your tools:

```json
{
  "schema": "https://open-and-sustainable.github.io/revaise-model/schema/latest/revaise.schema.json",
  "context": "https://open-and-sustainable.github.io/revaise-model/schema/latest/context.jsonld",
  "docs": "https://open-and-sustainable.github.io/revaise-model/docs/latest/"
}
```

## Vision

We envision a future where:

- Every AI-assisted systematic review is fully transparent and reproducible
- Researchers can seamlessly build upon each other's work
- AI tools enhance rather than obscure the review process
- The scientific community has complete confidence in AI-assisted evidence synthesis

**Join us in making this vision a reality.**
